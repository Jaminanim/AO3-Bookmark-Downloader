2. ADVERTISEMENT RESTRICTIONS: Any software incorporating a substantial portion of this code may include advertisements only if ALL of the following conditions are met:

   a) IMMEDIATE DISPLAY & DISMISSAL: 
      - Advertisements must be displayed immediately when triggered (no pre-display timers, loading screens, or countdown delays)
      - Advertisements must be skippable or dismissible from the moment they appear, with no mandatory waiting period
      - The skip/dismiss action must take effect immediately upon interaction (no processing delays or animations before dismissal)

   b) SKIP CONTROL REQUIREMENTS: The skip/dismiss control must:
      - Be a single, clearly labeled button or control (text must include "Skip", "Close", "Dismiss", "X", or similar unambiguous language in the same language as the primary app interface)
      - Occupy at least 15% of the visible screen area OR have minimum dimensions of 200x100 pixels, whichever is larger
      - Use contrasting colors that make it clearly distinguishable from the background (minimum WCAG AA contrast ratio)
      - Maintain 100% opacity and full visibility at all times
      - Remain in a fixed, consistent location throughout the advertisement display
      - Function immediately with a single tap/click without any confirmation dialogs, secondary actions, or gesture requirements
      - Not be obscured by any other elements, including the advertisement itself or any overlays
      - Be visible and functional immediately upon any advertisement-related display (including containers, frames, or screens)
      - Have its clickable/tappable area exactly match its visible boundaries
      - Respond to standard click/tap events without requiring hover, long-press, swipe, or other special interactions

   c) PROHIBITED PRACTICES: The following are explicitly forbidden:
      - Fake, decoy, or non-functional skip buttons
      - Moving, animated, or position-changing skip buttons
      - Skip buttons that trigger additional content, pages, or advertisements before dismissing
      - Sequential or chained advertisements (dismissing one ad must not immediately trigger another)
      - Interstitial ads that cannot be immediately dismissed
      - Any form of forced video or audio playback that continues after skip/dismiss
      - Skip buttons that are partially or fully off-screen or require scrolling to access
      - Skip buttons where the clickable area does not exactly match the visual button boundaries
      - Transparent overlays or invisible elements that intercept skip button interactions
      - Skip buttons that only pause, minimize, or hide advertisements rather than fully dismissing them
      - Post-dismissal screens (such as "thank you" pages or advertisement feedback requests)
      - Reloading or respawning advertisements after dismissal
      - Disabling, dimming, or altering skip button functionality based on user behavior or interaction
      - Any mechanism that attempts to circumvent or subvert these requirements through technical means
